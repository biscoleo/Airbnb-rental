# Airbnb Rentals in 5 major US cities
This group project was for a statistics course. 

RESEARCH QUESTION
Can we determine the factors that contribute most to the cost of an Airbnb rental and
create a model that can predict the price based on these features?

We used a regression tree to explore this question in R.
